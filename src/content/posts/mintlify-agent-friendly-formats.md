## Excellence in Agent Experience

One great example of thoughtful agent experience design comes from Mintlify, a documentation provider that’s naturally incentivized to be early here. Documentation is foundational to building software projects, which makes it a leading indicator of AI adoption.

### What Makes It Great

1. **Copy page button** — Each page includes a button to copy the page in Markdown or open it directly in ChatGPT. This makes it easy to ask questions or start using their MCP server to work with their tools through an LLM.  
2. **`LLMs.txt` files** — Appending `/LLMs.txt` to any doc URL gives you a lightweight, LLM-friendly version that updates automatically. It basically helps the LLM understand how to navigate your site by showing a breakdown of the structure.  
3. **`LLMsFull` option** — An extended version that includes all your documentation content. It’s probably too much for any one LLM at once, but it’s useful as a more comprehensive reference.

### Example Usage


These small touches make it easier for LLMs to find, interpret, and use your content—without adding extra maintenance.

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- Build documentation in LLM-friendly formats  
- Support direct LLM interaction and querying  
- Keep machine-readable content automatically updated  
- Treat docs as both human- and agent-facing interfaces
