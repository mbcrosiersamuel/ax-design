Supabase has been one of the biggest winners of the vibe-coding era, for a simple reason: they have a great 'Agent Experience' (AX). In this case, it mainly means they have great APIs that allow for easy integrations with other AI-based tools.

A lot of developer tools (and, tools in general) require users to log in and click around extensively to make things happen. In his talk at YC Startup School, Andrej Karpathy highlighted this, using excerpts from the docs of Clerk, an authentication provider, as an example:

Since setup requires lots of clicking and buttons, this is extremely hard for agents to execute on their own. Some companies have started to realize this, and are actively working toward replacing 'clicks' or other user-centric steps, with agent-friendly options based on code.

In contrast, Supabase got this right from the start. In addition to being user-friendly, Supabase's tools are also agent- and integration-friendly, allowing for setup and provisioning directly via APIs and code, without requiring humans to click around at all.

As a result, Supabase quickly saw the benefits of prioritizing Agent Experience (AX) as it became the preferred database provider for a wide range of vibe coding tools:

In fact, all of the vibe-coding tools except Replit (who has a database offering of their own) integrated with Supabase.

This also pushed Supabase's valuation to extraordinary heights:

This is noteworthy because it proves an important point: Good AX and investment in full-featured APIs can create a lot of enterprise value!
